# Sales Prediction App

## Cloud IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In your Cloud IDE, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Dataset Content
* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace. 
* The dataset has almost 1.5 thousand rows and represents housing records from Ames, Iowa, indicating house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Wood Deck, Year Built) and its respective sale price for houses built between 1872 and 2010.

## Business Requirements
As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximising the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that.

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how the house attributes correlate with the sale price. Therefore, the client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.
* 2 - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* We predict that 1stFlrSF will be the feature that most closely correlates to the properties' SalePrice
* All the features will be compared to the target (SalePrice) and the most correlated features will be shown


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks
* The client wishes to discover how house attributes correlate with sale prices. Therefore, the client expects data visualizations of the correlated variables against the sale price.
* A regressor model was used in this case to be able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the explanatory variables.
* The dashboard will contain a graph of the most impactful variable and will also contain a cluster analysis which will be devided in 3 clusters.
* The dashboard will also contain a page to predict sales price by inputing the 9 most impactful features which allows the client to maximize sales price for the inherited properties.
* We agreed with the client an R2 score of at least 0.75 on the train set as well as on the test set.


## Dashboard Design
* The first page in the dashboard will be a quick summary which contains project terms and business requirements
* The second page will contain allow the client to input data from the 9 most impactful vairables from their inherited houses and the dashboard will give a predicted sales price for the proposed property.
* The third page contains the hypothesis of which feature is most impactful to sales price.
* The fourth page contains an evaluation of pipline tested with the test and train set using R2 score.
* The firth page contains a multiple graphic visualiations of the cluster analysis that as well as a range of of each cluster of each impactful feature

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://predict-sales-app-98929437a4b0.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.
